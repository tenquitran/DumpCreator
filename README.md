# DumpCreator

DumpCreator is a Windows API console application to debug a target program (by launching it or by attaching to its process). 
On an exception, creates a minidump. Displays the process exit event.

Notes:
- should run as an Administrator.
- to debug a 64-bit process, DumpCreator should be built as a 64-bit process, too.
